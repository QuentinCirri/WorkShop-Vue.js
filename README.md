# WorkShop: How to Install Vue.js, Typescript , and Taildwind CSS
This workshop provides a step-by-step guide on installing and setting up Vue.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for efficient and modern web development.

First of all, before you can install Vue.js you need to have **node.js** installed on your computer whit an up-to-date version. :warning:

Here is the link if you don't have [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en ) on your computer. 


### How to install Vue.js
The first step will be to open your terminal and enter this command:

``` npm create vue@latest ```

You should see this on your screen:

Here, you can name your project. We will name it "WorkShop Vue.js".

There will be multiple prompts. We will say "No" to all of them, including Typescript, which we will set up ourselves. :wink:
It should loot like this:

When it's done, you can run ``` npm run dev ```

Now, you should see your **localhost** adress, which you can now copy and paste into your browser's address bar.

Congratulation, you did it ! :crown: (You should see this)

We can go now to the next step. :point_down:

You can use two line of code to install TypeScript. **(We will use the first one)**

The first is to do in your porject 
```npm install typescript --save-dev```

The second one you can use it globaly  

``` npm install -g typescript ```
